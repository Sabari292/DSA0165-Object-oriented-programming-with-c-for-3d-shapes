a. What will be the output of the fragment above if the interactive user enters the integer value 0 ?
b. What will be the output of the fragment above if the interactive user enters the integer value 15 ?
c. What will be the output of the fragment above if the interactive user enters the integer value 7 ?
d. What values for n will cause the output of the fragment above to be "not interesting"?

ANSWER:
