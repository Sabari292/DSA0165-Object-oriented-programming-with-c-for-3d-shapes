10. Rewrite the following code fragment so that it uses a "do...while..." loop to accomplish the same
task.
int n;
cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
cin >> n;
while (n < 0)
{
cout << "The integer you entered is negative." << endl;
cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
cin >> n;
}

ANSWER:

int n;
do {
    cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
    cin >> n;
} while (n < 0);
